Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
AI-Based Inventory Management System
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document provides a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the AI-Based Inventory Management System. The purpose of the system is to provide automated inventory management, predictive stock requirements, and reporting to streamline stock management processes, using AI for forecasting and anomaly detection.

1.2 Scope
The AI-Based Inventory Management System will:

Provide real-time inventory tracking.
Use predictive analytics to forecast demand and supply needs.
Detect anomalies in stock levels.
Integrate a user-friendly interface for inventory management.
The system will be developed using Python, Flask (backend), React (frontend), and AI models for analytics.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
AI: Artificial Intelligence.
Inventory: The stock of goods or products stored by a business.
API: Application Programming Interface.
UI: User Interface.
ML: Machine Learning.
1.4 References
Flask documentation: Flask
React documentation: React
Python documentation: Python
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The AI-Based Inventory Management System will be a standalone web application providing inventory tracking and management capabilities with AI-based predictions. The application will have a three-tier architecture consisting of the client side (React), server side (Flask), and database, and it will communicate through RESTful APIs.

2.2 Product Functions
Inventory Tracking: Track items in the inventory with real-time updates.
Demand Forecasting: Predict demand and restocking needs using machine learning.
Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual activity in stock levels (e.g., sudden drops or spikes).
Automated Alerts: Notify users when items are running low or require replenishment.
Report Generation: Generate periodic reports on stock levels, usage patterns, and predicted needs.
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
Inventory Managers: Track inventory levels, add/remove stock, view reports, and analyze forecasts.
Sales Managers: Monitor sales-related inventory metrics and evaluate demand forecasts.
Admins: Manage user access and permissions, configure system settings, and oversee the entire inventory process.
2.4 Operating Environment
Frontend: React (JavaScript) running in a web browser.
Backend: Flask (Python) hosted on a server.
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for storing inventory data.
Machine Learning: Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for demand forecasting and anomaly detection.
2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
Scalability: The system must handle up to 10,000 items in the inventory with high performance.
Data Privacy: User authentication and role-based access control must be implemented to ensure data security.
API Rate Limiting: APIs must include rate limiting to handle high loads efficiently.
2.6 User Documentation
The system will provide:

User Manual: Instructions on how to use the system and access various features.
Admin Guide: Configuration and user management instructions for administrators.
2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
Reliable internet connection for accessing the web-based UI.
Access to data from external sources (e.g., sales records) for improved forecasting accuracy.
Dependency on Flask, React, and machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn).
3. System Features
3.1 Real-Time Inventory Tracking
Description: Allows users to monitor stock levels in real-time.
Inputs: SKU codes, item names, quantities.
Processing: Update and retrieve inventory data from the database.
Outputs: Display current inventory status.
3.2 Predictive Analytics for Demand Forecasting
Description: Uses machine learning models to forecast demand for specific items based on historical data.
Inputs: Historical sales data, seasonality, and trends.
Processing: Apply predictive algorithms on inventory data.
Outputs: Predicted stock requirements for future periods.
3.3 Anomaly Detection
Description: Detects unusual patterns in stock levels and provides alerts.
Inputs: Current and historical inventory data.
Processing: Anomaly detection algorithms flag unexpected variations.
Outputs: Alerts for abnormal stock changes (e.g., shrinkage or unexpected demand).
3.4 Automated Alerts
Description: Sends notifications when stock levels reach a threshold or need replenishing.
Inputs: Defined thresholds for each item.
Processing: Monitors inventory levels and triggers alerts when thresholds are met.
Outputs: Notifications via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.
3.5 Report Generation
Description: Generates reports on inventory levels, usage patterns, and predictions.
Inputs: Inventory and sales data.
Processing: Aggregate data and present it in customizable reports.
Outputs: Weekly, monthly, or custom reports available for download.
4. External Interface Requirements
4.1 User Interfaces
Login Page: Secure login for all users.
Dashboard: Displays inventory levels, alerts, and analytics.
Inventory Details Page: Shows item-level details and historical trends.
Reports Page: Allows access to generated reports.
Settings Page: For configuring thresholds, alerts, and user roles.
4.2 Hardware Interfaces
The system is accessed via web browsers; no specific hardware requirements are anticipated.

4.3 Software Interfaces
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for data storage.
API: RESTful API endpoints for React to interact with Flask backend.
Machine Learning Models: Integrates with predictive models developed in Python.
4.4 Communication Interfaces
Protocol: HTTP/HTTPS for communication between frontend and backend.
Notifications: Email or SMS API integration for sending alerts.
5. Non-functional Requirements
5.1 Performance Requirements
The system should support up to 100 concurrent users.
Forecasting algorithms should complete within 5 seconds on average for large datasets.
5.2 Security Requirements
Authentication: Secure login with user roles (admin, manager).
Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
Access Control: Role-based access to restrict features based on user role.
5.3 Usability Requirements
